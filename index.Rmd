> Our team, the Circuit Breakers, has good amount of experience with robotics. We have done many outreach activities through a non-profit organization, Robotics For Youth (RFY). We have been to expos and events that allowed us to represent who we are. We have introduced FLL and FTC to many kids and we continue giving them advice and information on how to participate in these competitions. We are also giving our expert advice to a rookie FLL team in designing their robot and programming techniques.

>> This FTC season, we have built a fully functional robot and we have had a good start in programming. In our meetings, we usually split up into groups and accomplish tasks such as building the robot, programming, and our goals towards outreach activities.

>>> This year, we have completed many tasks and we are looking forward to continuing FTC in the future as well.
